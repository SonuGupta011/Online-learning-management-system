An Online Learning Management System (LMS) is a digital platform designed to deliver, manage, and track educational or training content efficiently. It provides tools for course creation, user management, assessments, and analytics, catering to diverse roles such as administrators, instructors, and learners. Users can access learning materials, complete assignments, participate in discussions, and receive feedback, all in one centralized platform. LMS platforms often support multimedia content, real-time communication tools like video conferencing, and gamification elements to enhance engagement. They are widely used in educational institutions for e-learning and by organizations for corporate training and skill development
